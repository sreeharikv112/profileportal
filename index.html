        <h3>Web development</h3>
        <p>I have experience in Angular and SpringBoot. I am brushing up my HTML, CSS , JS and Node skills. Before deep diving into HTML basics, I had to work with Angular directly!! Oopss. For which
          I used SpringBoot as the backend and MySql as Database. And as I mentioned earlier Angular was the front end. I was quite successful in bringing out all the requirements along with WOW monents in those solutions.
           As I wanted to get strong hold on web portal design, decided to concentrate on web designing.

        <h3>Mobile app development</h3>
        <p>Expert in Android applications. Worked on iOS and learning Flutter now a days. As I have a strong hold in Java and Kotlin, either Blackberry or Android was kinda interesting for me personally.
            But later I found out more opportunity in iOS, started learning iOS. But considering the dynamic eco system, felt that it is important to have very stong hold on web applications as well. Hence I am investing more time to
            deepdive into web applications.
